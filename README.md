# colemak-dh-lv-apostophe
A keyboard layout / s that merges colemak-dh and Latvian (apostrophe).
This layout makes the key *'* a *dead key*. This specific key was chosen thanks to the already existing keyboard layout that uses it and also it's conveniently located on the home row.

#Changes from colemak-dh:
- **'** + **A**/**a** -> **Ā**/**ā**
- **'** + **E**/**e** -> **Ē**/**ē**
- **'** + **I**/**i** -> **Ī**/**ī**
- **'** + **O**/**o** -> **Ō**/**ō** (As far as I know nobody uses this letter but why not have it anyways)
- **'** + **U**/**u** -> **Ū**/**u**
- **'** + **S**/**s** -> **Š**/**š**
- **'** + **G**/**g** -> **Ģ**/**g**
- **'** + **K**/**k** -> **Ķ**/**ķ**
- **'** + **L**/**l** -> **Ļ**/**ļ**
- **'** + **N**/**n** -> **Ņ**/**ņ**
- **'** + **Z**/**z** -> **Ž**/**z**
- ' + ' -> '
- ' + \[any-not-mentioned] -> '\[any-not-mentioned]
- AltGr + [any] -> [any]
